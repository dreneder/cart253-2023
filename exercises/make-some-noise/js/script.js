/**
 * Make some cart noise
 * Andr√© Neder
 * 
 * This is a manual car or, at least, part of it. It has a manual transmission and ignition controlled by the mouse,
 * a clutch, brake and gas pedals controlled by the A, S, D keys respectively. The main manipulation of the sound is
 * through the RPM, that is changing the rate and amplitude of the engine sound. Some sounds just play according
 * to interaction.
 * What can I say, enjoy making car sounds!
