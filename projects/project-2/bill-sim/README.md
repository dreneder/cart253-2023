# 2024 Billionaire Simulator

This game is about space travel, where you have to launch a rocket and travel to Mars. Each of these is a different stage of the game. The main objective is to give the user a little feeling of NASA engineer and to understand how meticulously space missions and trajectories are planned and calculated. At the end of the game the user must lad safely on Mars and for that it is needed to reduce speed enough to not crash.

The initial code was based on different orbit simulations found on YouTube an GitHub, but finally it was addapted to the mechanics of the p5play library by Quinton Ashley, which was imported into the project. A lot had to be adapted to the old code due to the use of sprites and 

Vector components of the space vehicles were made in Adobe Illustrator and exported as PNG.
