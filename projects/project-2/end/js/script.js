/**
 * 2024 Billionaire Simulator: Mission to Mars
 * AndrÃ© Neder
 * 
 * The Billionaire Simulator (BS for short) is based based on the current commercial space race and the
 * rich people that take part in it. The game is divided in two parts: the launch and the interplanetary
 * travel to Mars. The code makes a huge use of the p5play library by Quinton Ashley, so all of the
 * objects have been written as sprites, so the camera object could work properly.
 * Initially the codewas based on gravity prototypes by Miachel Ruppe: https://github.com/michaelruppe/art/tree/master/solar-system-p5
 * and Bruno M.: https://github.com/Bruno-M-/gravity
 * Finaly they were all adapted to the mechanics built in p5play.
