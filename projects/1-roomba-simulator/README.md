# 2023 Roomba Simulator

This is a robot vacuum cleaner simulation that allows users to advance through stages as they clean a certain pertange of a room. Cats are the challenging layer of the simulation, they move randomly, attach to the robot and reduce its' speed, not to mention that they make an annoying "MEOW" at everytime the get on or off the roomba.

On the roomba simulation the base code is a modified version from the polar coordinates tutorial. A lot of the code is based on past class material and some from tutorials from different websites such as "The Coding Train". The cat and dirt mechanisms are made with different arrays. The main objective was to make a functional, funny and entertaining prpject. Images are sourced and liscensed from Envato Elements.

The main inputs and commands are:
UP ARROW - moves the roomba forward
DOWN ARROW - moves the roomba backward
LEFT ARROW - rotates the roomba to the left by 0.5 radians at a rate
RIGHT ARROW - rotates the roomba to the right by 0.5 radians at a rate
MOUSE CLICK - shows instructions on the title screen
SPACEBAR - advances through the screens or stages, enables audio playback on the title screen and refreshes the browser page at the ending screen
