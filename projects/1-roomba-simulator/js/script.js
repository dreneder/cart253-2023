/**
 * 2023 Roomba Simulator
 * AndrÃ© Neder
 * 
 * Folowing the success of Farming, Euro Truck and Surgeon Simulator, I'm glad to bring another mundane task to
 * the enterteinment of people which is: cleaning the house! In the 2023 Roomba Simulator you get to experience in
 * a bird's eye view, how it is to be a robot vacuum cleaner in service of lazy human beings.
 * In this simulation, you start at a charging base and you have to clean as many rooms as you can before you
 * battery runs off completely. After cleaning a room you get back to base for a little more charge.
 * If you run over an object like a sock or a toy, your suction motor's torque increases, so you consume more battery.
 *
 * You need to clean as many rooms as you can before your battery runs out, but if you don't clean the room enough it
 * doesn't count.
 * Don't raise your expectations too high, the objective of this game is literally to suck.
